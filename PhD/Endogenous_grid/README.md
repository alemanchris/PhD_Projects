# Piecewise linear approximation of the invariant distribution of assets 
The following code solves Aiyagari(94) using the endogenous grid method.
It then approximates the invariant distribution using global methods.
The code runs in Julia 1.0.
The solution method is taken form the slides of the course in Quantitative Macro given by Prof. Gianluca Violante.
